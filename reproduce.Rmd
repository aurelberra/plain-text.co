# Minimize Error 

We have already seen how the right set of tools can save you time by automatically highlighting the syntax of your code, ensuring everything you cite ends up in your bibliography, picking out mistakes in syntax, and providing templates for commonly-used methods or functions. Your time is saved twice over: you don't repeat yourself, and you make fewer errors you'd otherwise have to fix. When it comes to managing ongoing projects, minimizing error means addressing two related problems. The first is to find ways to further reduce the opportunity for errors to creep in without you noticing. This is especially important when it comes to coding and analyzing data. The second is to find a way to figure out, retrospectively, what it was you did to generate a particular result. Using a revision control system gets us a good distance down this road. But there is more we can do at the level of particular reports or papers.

Errors in data analysis often well up out of the gap that typically exists between the procedure used to produce a figure or table in a paper and the subsequent use of that output later. In the ordinary way of doing things, you have the code for your data analysis in one file, the output it produced in another, and the text of your paper in a third file. You do the analysis, collect the output and copy the relevant results into your paper, often manually reformatting them on the way. Each of these transitions introduces the opportunity for error. In particular, it is easy for a table of results to get detached from the sequence of steps that produced it. Almost everyone who has written a quantitative paper has been confronted with the problem of reading an old draft containing results or figures that need to be revisited or reproduced (as a result of peer-review, say) but which lack any information about the circumstances of their creation. Academic papers take a long time to get through the cycle of writing, review, revision, and publication, even when you're working hard the whole time. It is not uncommon to have to return to something you did two years previously in order to answer some question or other from a reviewer. You do not want to have to do everything over from scratch in order to get the right answer. I am not exaggerating when I say that, whatever the challenges of replicating the results of someone else's quantitative analysis, after a fairly short period of time authors themselves find it hard to replicate their *own* work. Computer Science people have a term of art for the inevitable process of decay that overtakes a project simply in virtue of its being left alone on the hard drive for six months or more: bit--rot.

# Use Markdown to Write Documents

An important way to caulk this gap is to use [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) when doing quantitative analysis in R. [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a way of writing plain text that includes information about the formatting of your document. It was originally developed by John Gruber, with input from Aaron Swartz. The aim was to make a simple format that could incorporate structural information about the document (such as headings and subheadings, *emphasis*, [hyperlinks](http://daringfireball.net/markdown), lists, footnotes, and so on), with minimal loss of readability. Formats like HTML or TeX are much more extensive markup languages, but Markdown was meant to be simple. Over the years it has become a *de facto* standard. Text editors and note-taking applications support it, and tools exist to convert Markdown not just into HTML (its original target output format) but many other document types as well. @lst:markdown-example shows the markdown source for this paragraph and its subheading.

```{#lst:markdown-example .markdown caption="The Markdown source for a nearby part of this document."}
### Using Markdown, RMarkdown and `knitr` 

An important way to caulk this gap is to use
[RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and
[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) when doing quantitative analysis in
R. [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a way of
writing plain text that includes information about the formatting of
your document. It was originally developed by John Gruber, with input
from Aaron Swartz. The aim was to make a simple format that could
incorporate structural information about the document (such as
headings and subheadings, *emphasis*,
[hyperlinks](http://daringfireball.net/markdown), lists, footnotes,
and so on), with minimal loss of readability. Formats like HTML or TeX
are much more extensive markup languages, but Markdown was meant to be
simple. Over the years it has become a *de facto* standard. Text
editors and note-taking applications support it, and tools exist to
convert Markdown not just into HTML (its original target output
format) but many other document types as well. @lst:markdown-example shows 
the markdown source for this paragraph and its subheading.
```

The excerpt shown in @lst:markdown-example shows a few of the most
common Markdown conventions, most notably the standard way of
representing hyperlinks, and emphasizing text. There are a number of
Markdown variants, or "flavors", that have extended it to manage
things like cross-references and labels, citations, and other textual
elements. Citations are particularly important. The `pandoc-citeproc`
filter is an add-on that handles these. It can be installed alongside
`pandoc`. Your bibliography can be stored in one of a variety of
formats (such as BibTeX, or EndNote). Within your `.md` document,
cites are referred to by their key, such as
`[@healy14datavisualsociol]`. When `pandoc` converts your document,
the cite key is replaced with the reference information like this
[@healy14datavisualsociol], and the full bibliographic entry is
included in an automaticaly-generated list of references. Read
[Pandoc's documentation for more details](http://pandoc.org/README.html#citations)
about citations. At the end of the excerpt you can also see that the
code listing is labeled with `@lst:markdown-example`, for example. A
Pandoc filter named
[`pandoc-crossref`](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref)
extends this `@label` convention to deal with labeled Figures, Tables,
and so on. Using Markdown in this way means you do not have to worry
whether your reference list is complete, or whether cross-references
(to 'Figure 3' for example) remain correct after you move things
around in your text.


# Using RMarkdown and `knitr` to Include Code

All of this applies just to `.md` documents. What about data analysis?
RMarkdown is a way to incorporate R code into this process. This
approach is designed to integrate the plain-text documentation or
writeup of a data analysis and its execution. You write the text of
your paper (or, more often, your report documenting a data analysis)
as normal. Whenever you want to run a model, produce a table or
display a figure, rather than paste in the results of your work from
elsewhere, you write down the R code that will produce the output you
want. These "chunks" of code can be interspersed throughout the
document. They are distinguished from the regular text by a special
delimiter at the beginning and end of the block.

When you're ready, you `knit` the document. That is, you feed it to R,
which processes the code chunks, and produces a finished version where
the code chunks have been replaced by their output. This is now a nice
markdown file that you can then turn into a PDF or HTML document.
Conversely, if you just want to extract the code you've written from
the surrounding text, then you "tangle" the file, which results in an
`.R` file. It's pretty straightforward in practice. The strength of
this approach is that is makes it much easier to document your work
properly. There is just one file for both the data analysis and the
writeup. The output of the analysis is created on the fly, and the
code to do it is embedded in the paper. If you need to do multiple but
identical (or very similar) analyses of different bits of data,
RMarkdown and `knitr` can make generating consistent and reliable
reports much easier.

RMarkdown is one of several "literate programming" formats. The idea
goes back to Donald Knuth, the pioneering theorist of computer science
who developed the TeX typesetting system in his spare time. Although
his focus was on documenting computer programs, in retrospect Knuth
anticipated many of the main ideas---and developed several of the
initial tools---for reproducible data analysis.

@fig:example-figure-r, for instance, could be generated on the fly from source-code blocks included in the `.Rmd` source for this article. Sometimes we will want to only show the results produced by the code---in this case, @fig:example-figure-r. But at other times we will want to display the code as well, as in @lst:r-example. 


![Tea and Biscuits](figures/example-figure-1.png){#fig:example-figure-r}

```{#lst:r-example .r caption="R code snippet."}
library(ggplot2)
tea <- rnorm(100)
biscuits <- tea + rnorm(100,0,1.3)
data <- data.frame(tea, biscuits)
p <- ggplot(data, aes(x=tea, y=biscuits)) + 
   geom_smooth(method="lm") + 
   labs(x="Tea", y="Biscuits") + theme_bw() 
print(p)   
```

`knitr` and RMarkdown make it easy to produce HTML output, too. This makes for easy portability, conversion, and quick previewing while editing. You can work with RMarkdown files in any text editor, and Emacs has strong support for them. RStudio also comes with built-in support for `.Rmd` files and makes it very easy to produce HTML and PDF output, and to publish your reports to the web via its [RPubs](http://rpubs.com) service.

The literate programming approach has its limits. For large or complex analyses it can still make more sense to produce the final result in pieces rather than all at once in a single `.Rmd` file. This is one of the reasons it remains important to manage your projects using some kind of version control, so you can keep track of work that is needed but might not fit inside a single `.Rmd` document.
