# Using Marked

In everyday use, I find Brett Terpstra's application [Marked](http://marked2app.com) to be a very useful way of previewing text while writing. Marked shows you your Markdown files as HTML, updating the preview on the fly whenever changes are saved in the Markdown file. It can render ordinary Markdown by default, but it also supports `pandoc` as a custom processor. This means it can manage the various extra bells and whistles of scholarly formatting discussed so far. Essentially, you tell Marked run a `pandoc` command similar or identical the one shown above to generate its HTML previews. You do this in the "Advanced" tab of Marked's preferences. The "Path" field in the preferences dialog contains the full path to `pandoc`, and the "Args" field contains all the relevant command switches---in my case, the same as in the Makefile above.

When editing your markdown file in your favorite text editor, you point Marked at the file and get a live preview. You can add the [CSS files in the pandoc-templates repository](https://github.com/kjhealy/pandoc-templates/blob/master/marked/kultiad-serif.css) to the list of Custom CSS files Marked knows about, via the "Style" tab in the Preferences window. That way, Marked's preview will look the same as the HTML file that's produced. @fig:marked-example shows what this looks like in practice.

The upshot of all of this is powerful editing using Emacs, [ESS](http://ess.r-project.org), R, and other tools; flexible conversion using pandoc; quick and easy previewing via HTML and Marked; and high-quality PDF typesetting at the same time (or whenever needed). All of it can be generated directly from plain text, and will include almost all of the machinery most scholarly papers need, most notably properly labeled Tables and Figures that can be cross-referenced in the text. While it all may seem quite complex when laid out in this way, in use it is quite straightforward, and doesn't require any thought when in use. I just live in my text editor. The various scripts and settings do their work quietly, and I get the formatted output I want. 

# An Emacs Starter Kit 

A step-by-step guide to downloading and installing every piece of software I've mentioned so far is beyond the scope of this discussion. But let's say you take the plunge and download Emacs, a TeX distribution, R, and maybe even Git. Now what? If you're going to work in Emacs, there are a variety of tweaks and add-ons that are very helpful but not set by default. To make things a little easier, I maintain an [Emacs Starter Kit for the Social Sciences](http://kjhealy.github.com/emacs-starter-kit/). It's designed to smooth out Emacs' rough edges by giving you a drop-in collection of default settings, as well as automatically installing some important add-on packages. It will, I hope, help you skirt the abyss of Setting Things Up Forever.
